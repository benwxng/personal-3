## 2024 wrapped

-   ran my first half-marathon

-   worked for a goated boss then had to leave to not fail highschool

-   felt lost

-   graduated highschool, won tennis state champtionship with my brothers

-   lived with my relatives in hawaii for a month

-   watched the sunrise from the top of koko crator

-   began a new chapter of life at Swarthmore

## 4 things I'll be working on increasing in 2025

## speed

-   closing mental loops faster

-   not waiting to do things that can be accomplished quickly

-   working, getting feedback, iterating quicker

## agency

-   upskilling and doing quality work that i'm proud of

-   taking responsibility for everything in my control

-   planting my feet and building with what i have

## luck

-   being maximally prepared for opportunity

-   more focused effort

## faith

-   understanding that i am nothing without God's love

-   having true fear of disobedience and life without God

## thoughts/lessons from 2024

-   my actions determine my feelings, not the other way around

-   inspiration is impermanent

-   whatever you aren't changing you're choosing

-   don't settle

i hope all of us have the best year of our lives.
